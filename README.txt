
This is my basic tank game

INSTRUCTIONS

PLAYER 1 CONTROLS
    - move left and right with [a] and [d]
    - aim up and down with [w] and [s]
    - hold [SPACE] to shoot
    
PLAYER 2 CONTROLS
    - move left and right with [LEFT] and [RIGHT]
    - aim up and down with [UP] and [DOWN]
    - hold [SPACE] to shoot
    
You can redo the level by pressing [ENTER]
    - this can help you see the randomization of the tank positions and the wind velocity
    
Each player will have some fuel
    - the fuel will refill every turn
    - if the player uses all of his/her fuel this turn, he will not be able to shoot this turn
    
A player will die after being hit once
    - the health bar was just added cuz it looks cool...
    
Turn off the game by pressing [ESC]

Note: If you shoot with very little power, the missile will not show up
    
HAVE FUN (hopefully)!

p.s. sorry for the messy code...
